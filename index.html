  <div><img class="mug" src="coffee-cup.jpg" alt="coffee cup" width="800" height="600"></div>
  <p> Starbucks has a variety of roasts customer's can choose from.
    There most popular roast is Pike, a medium roast preferred by many customers
    and brewed each day. The usual dark roast is Verona and the
  usual blonde roast is Veranda. These are also customer favorites and
are brewed each day. However, there are occasions where specialty and limited
roasts are brewed, such as the famous "Christmas Blend" that is served
each year in the month of December. There are Starbucks all around the world totalling over 25,000 different stores today.
Starbucks originated in 1971 in Seattle, Washington and has grown to arguably the most well-known coffee shop in the world.</p>

<h2>Starbucks Reserve</h2>
<div><img class="reserve" src="coffee-shop.jpg" alt="coffee shop" width="800" height="600"></div>

  <p> Starbucks Reserves are less common, but go above and beyond to provide the best
  coffee experience for each customer. They are small batch, single orgin coffees, not found
  at normal Starbucks. Some now even serve coffee icecream with an affagotto espresso shot. The inside of these
  reserves are exquisite, focusing on a serene and hip atmosphere for customers to enjoy their
  special blend. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>500 Reserve Stores in the US</li>
    <li>150 in China</li>
    <li>90 in Europe</li>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>I have loved Starbucks for several years. I used to study there in high school and always had a great experience with each employee and loved the products I ordered.
        Since then, I have become a partner myself and work at the Starbucks in downtown Athens.
        I love being able to know how each drink is made and being able to explore different flavors and combinations myself. </p>

      <h2>My Favorite Drink</h2>
      <p> I love several different drinks, but my favorite is called the Starbucks Doubleshot.
        It is made from shaken espresso, a flavor of your choice (I like caramel), topped off with half and half and served over ice. </p>
